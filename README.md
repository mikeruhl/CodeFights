# CodeFights
various codefights.com solutions in no particular order.


## Overview

I signed up for Codefights.com. 

There are two projects: a test project and a main project.  Arcade levels are in their own groupings denoted by the class name to keep it semi-clean.  However, since this is just a test bed, I mostly just did whatever the heck I wanted.  For the most part, method names are the same as they appear on CodeFights.

As I complete stuff on the site, I will most likely refactor things to make it more organized.
