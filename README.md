# CodeFights
My username on CodeFights is also **mikeruhl**.  Friend me.  Challenge me.  Message me.  High-Five me.


## Overview

I signed up for Codefights.com. This represents solutions on there.  All are in C#.  I will be posting Python solutions to the Python-specific tracks in a separate repo once I start those.  **I ***URGE*** you to try the problems before grabbing a solution from someone else.**  Some of these are tough.  Some took me days to figure out.  I am not an algorithm builder by trade, but I want to be better so I started this.  And you know what?  I'm thinking differently.  It wasn't from copy/pasting code just to get points.  It was from getting really down on myself, feeling like a failure, spending hours on StackOverflow and dotnetperls and reading up on basic calculus that I haven't touched since college (if not high school), and then bumbling through until it worked.

Many of my solutions probably barely squeek by on efficiency.  I know my solutions aren't the most elegant.  I don't refactor after a success.  I move on.  I have noticed areas for improving but there are a lot of challenges and I want to hit as many as possible.  Perhaps in the very distant future, once I've exhausted all CodeFights has to offer, I will go back through and refactor.

There are two projects: a test project and a main project.  Arcade levels are in their own groupings denoted by the class name to keep it semi-clean.  However, since this is just a test bed, I mostly just did whatever the heck I wanted.  For the most part, method names are the same as they appear on CodeFights.  Some challenges appear multiple times in different sections.  If you can't find the method in the section, there should be a comment telling you where I originally completed it.  Fret not, it is somewhere in the sln.
