various codefights.com solutions in no particular order.


## Overview

I signed up for Codefights.com.  I'm keeping a repo so I can use 2 different machines to do this.  Currently, I'm only doing the Arcade track so the mehod names correspond to those challenges.  There are unit tests too.

There are two projects: a test project and a main project.  Arcade levels are in their own groupings denoted by the class name to keep it semi-clean.  However, since this is just a test bed, I mostly just did whatever the heck I wanted.  For the most part, method names are the same as they appear on CodeProjects.
